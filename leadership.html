                <p>Reverend Beverly S. Hudson accepted Jesus Christ and was baptized August 1975 at Mount Hermon
                    Missionary Baptist Church in Bishopville, South Carolina under the leadership of the late Rev. Bert
                    D. Lewis Sr This is where she gained her biblical foundation and passion to serve the
                    Lord.</p>
                <p>Rev. Bev graduated in 1986 from Morris College in Sumter, South Carolina with a
                    Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics. Rev. Bev is also a 2007 graduate of Jameson School
                    of Ministry with a Certificate in Biblical Studies and she is currently matriculating in the Master
                    of Divinity Program at Palmer Theological Seminary.
                    Professionally, she is an employee with the Department of Treasury.</p>
                <p>Rev. Bev is a member of the historic First African Baptist Church in Darby Township, Pennsylvania
                    where the Reverend Dr. Richard A. Dent is the Pastor. In addition to her Ministerial Duties, Rev.

                    Ministry, Youth Ministry and the Women of Faith Support Ministry.</p>
                <p>When she was lost, Rev. Bev sought the Lord, He heard her and delivered her from all of her fears; at
                    this point, she rededicated her life back to Jesus Christ and has not looked back. As she began to
                    study and
                    meditate on the Word of God, she found herself experiencing the deeper things of God.
                    After much prayer and fasting, she began to seek God for His will for her life and the result was
                    her call to preach the Good News of Jesus Christ; she was licensed to preach on June 26, 2011 and
                    ordained on November 4, 2012 by Rev. Dr. Richard A. Dent.</p>
                <p>The Lord blessed Rev. Bev with one son, Chad Jonathan Hudson. For such a time as this, she stands on
                    God’s promises and relies on, “Being confident of this, that He who began a good work in us will
                    carry it on to
                    completion until the day of Christ Jesus” – <a

                <p>Brother Kenneth J. D. Wilson was born a twin to the late Patricia Wilson and Kent Wilson in
                    Nuremberg, Germany on November 8, 1980.</p>
                <p>Kenneth and his twin brother Kevin were raised by their grandparents, George (deceased) and Mary
                    Atkings who took them to church and introduced them to the music ministry at an early age. Kenneth
                    was baptized and spiritually cultivated at Second Pilgrim Baptist Church where he served on the
                    youth choir and usher board. He later became a member of the New Way Missionary Baptist Church where
                    he was an active youth leader, Junior Deacon, Usher and Choir Director.</p>
                <p>After graduating from Saint Joseph’s Preparatory School in 1999, Kenneth went on to earn his Bachelor
                    of Arts degree in Sociology from the University of Connecticut and subsequently earned a Master’s in
                    Criminal Justice with a concentration in Behavioral Analysis in 2006. Currently, he is matriculating
                    in the Master of Divinity Program at Palmer Theological Seminary.</p>
                <p>Professionally, Kenneth is the Assistant Director of the Eva Donaldson School of Music. Driven by the
                    need to mentor young men of all ages, Kenneth is the founder of “A Different Breed of Men”, a
                    non-profit organization.</p>
                <p>After many years of wrestling with what he knew to be the voice of the Lord, Kenneth accepted the
                    call of ministry on his life in March 2007.</p>
                <p>As a faithful member of First African Baptist Church, Kenneth continues to prune his gift for
                    ministry as he actively serves in the following ministries: Discipleship training, Marriage
                    Ministry, Men’s Ministry, Chosen 300 and Music Ministry.</p>
                <p>On May 12, 2012, Kenneth was united in marriage to his long time love Nicole G. Bynum; the Lord
                    blessed them with three children: Tahjae, JaDen and Kai.</p>
                <p>In his servitude to the Lord, one of Kenneth’s favorite scripture is, “Moreover whom he did
                    predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: them he also
                    glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us who can be against us?” - <a
