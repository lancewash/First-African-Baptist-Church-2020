                            <p>The historic First African Baptist Church, which stands today on the corner of Clifton
                                and Laurel Avenue in Darby Township, was birthed into existence as a result of a vision
                                of two committed saints, Sister Louisa Spain and Sister Eliza Taylor. The two met and
                                formulated plans to establish a Township Mission in 1902. The first service was held in
                                the kitchen of Sister Spain’s home. Along with nine other souls, they organized a
                                Baptist Fellowship and in 1903 they moved into the first building at Hermesprota Creek
                                where the Reverend J. B. Brandon served as the first Pastor. In July of 1904, the church
                                was given the name First African Baptist Church.</p>
                            <p>The dream continued and in 1909, Rev. C. T. Wilcher was the leading spirit and under his
                                pastorate First African Baptist Church was incorporated as required by the Commonwealth
                                of Pennsylvania. Its stated purpose was to provide for the public worship of Almighty
                                God according to Baptist doctrine and the principles as set forth by God’s Holy Word,
                                Reverend Allen, Reverend W. E. Scott and Reverend J. Lincoln succeeded Reverend
                                Wilcher.</p>
                            <p>After a few years of being without a Pastor, the church called Reverend Booker W. Watkins
                                to be the undershepherd. He began his tenure in April, 1936 and he served faithfully and
                                tirelessly for forty years. During this period, the church grew and continued to be a
                                spiritual refuge in the community. The mortgage was burned and a parsonage was
                                constructed. As a testament to the growing congregation many organizations were formed.
                                Included were the Willing Workers, the Nurses Unit, The Rose of Sharon Missionary
                                Circle, the Heart in Hand, the Flower Club, the Hospitality Club, the Senior Ushers the
                                Pastor’s Aide, the Choir #2, the Young Adult Choir, the Junior Choir, the Church School
                                and Vacation Bible School. In 1971, a new edifice was completed. Pastor Watkins and the
                                congregation worshiped for the first time, in the new church on April 25, 1971. After
                                years of loving and committed service, Pastor Watkins went home to be with the Lord in
                                March of 1976.</p>
                            <p>After the death of Reverend Watkins, Reverend Charles Cunningham served as interim
                                Pastor. Reverend Jerry William Dailey assumed the pastorate in October 1977. During this
                                time, many innovative changes were implemented. Members were led to begin Tithing. A
                                Federal Credit Union was established. The B.W Watkins Memorial Scholarship Fund for high
                                school graduates was initiated and the transportation ministry began. Reverend Dailey
                                was called to another pastorate in 1982. Reverend Fredrick Randolph served as interim
                                pastor from 1982 – 1985.</p>
                            <p>In 1985, Reverend Dr. Richard A. Dent was called to lead the church. Following the vision
                                given to him, Reverend Dent was able to bring about a spiritual and physical
                                renaissance. Church membership and attendance increased dramatically, church facilities
                                were renovated, and the mortgage was burned. The ordination of Deacons and our first
                                female minister, the Reverend Margaret Quarcoo, took place and additional Trustees were
                                appointed. A full service transportation ministry was implemented consisting of three
                                vans, one of which is equipped to service the physically challenged and a
                                forty-passenger bus. In obedience to the mandates of the Lord, Pastor Dent began to
                                change the clubs and auxiliaries into ministries. This transformation enabled the church
                                to reach into the community and provide much-needed services. Out of these efforts, the
                                Neighbor to Neighbor Community Development Corporation came into existence. The services
                                provided at that time were the Emergency Food Cupboard, After-School Tutoring, the
                                After-School Care Program, and Camp Joy summer day camp. </p>
                            <p>The renewal of God’s people continued through the formation of additional active
                                ministries, both in reach and outreach. Some of which were the Men’s Ministry, the
                                Women’s Ministry, the Prison Ministry, the Chosen 300 (help for the homeless), the
                                Caring Ministry, visitation to the Juvenile Detention Center and to a Women’s Shelter
                                and several youth programs to minister to our large number of young people.</p>
                            <p>Continuing with the vision, the Nehemiah Project was launched for the building of a new
                                edifice to accommodate the continued growth of the Lord’s house. On the tenth day of
                                January 2004, Pastor Dent and the officers joyfully led the congregation into its new
                                sanctuary, where we continue to worship and praise a living Saviour. </p>
                            <p>In 2017, we received an amazingly generous, anonymous financial blessing, which allowed
                                us to pay off the church’s mortgage. To celebrate and praise God for His goodness, we
                                ceremonially burned the mortgage during our 114th Church Anniversary Service with joyful
                                and thankful hearts!</p>
                            <p>In 2018, we were blessed with the addition of two new preachers: Reverend George Thompson
                                and Reverend Horace Kinlaw. The Transportation Ministry retired the three church vans
                                and replaced them with two, and one van to service the physically disabled. After
                                several years of serving the congregation, our Credit Union evolved into the Ministry
                                Office, where they manage the finances of the church’s ministries. Also, we were blessed
                                to obtain full ownership of the Word of Life Bookstore. On December 31, 2019, Reverend
                                Dr. Richard A. Dent retired after 34 faithful years of leadership at First African
                                Baptist Church. In December, 2019, the church membership presented Reverend Dr. Richarad
                                A. Dent a Certificate electing him as Pastor Emeritus of First African Baptist
                                Church. </p>
                            <p>In January 2020, Reverend Beverly S. Hudson was selected to serve as Interim Pastor. God is good!</p>
